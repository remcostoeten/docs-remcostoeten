Search in dir: negative lookahead. In this case exclude sass folder which contains `static` but not `src/static`.

```shell filename="exclude in search"
(?!.\*\\static\\sass\\).
```

<small>
  This regular expression pattern uses a negative lookahead
  `(?!.*\\static\\sass\\)` to exclude any paths that contain `"\static\sass"`.
  It will only match paths that do not contain this specific directory
  structure. The . at the end of the pattern ensures that it matches all files
  and folders within the selected folder or workspace.
