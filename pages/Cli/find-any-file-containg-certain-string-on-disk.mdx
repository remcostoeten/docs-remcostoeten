### Find any file containing a certain word on the entire disk.

<hr />

In this case I lost my minesweeper project which had a git directory with the remote remcostoeten/minesweeper so this command will do:

```bash
find / -name "config" -exec grep -l "minesweeper" {} + 2>/dev/null
```

### Explanation:

<hr />

- `find / -name "config"`: Searches for all config files starting from the root directory `/`.
- `-exec grep -l "minesweeper" {} +`: For each config file found, `grep` searches for the string "minesweeper" in the file content and prints the filename (`-l` option) if it finds a match.
- `2>/dev/null`: Redirects errors to `/dev/null` to suppress permission denied messages.
