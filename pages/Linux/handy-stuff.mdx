### Just some stuff which I  will most likely need in the future.

 Disable having to fill in password when typing sudo
```bashrc
sudo EDITOR=vim visudo
```
1.  `sudo visudo` to open the sudoers file.
3. Find the line that looks like this: `%sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL`
4. Below this line, add a new line that looks like this: `username   ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL` (replace `username` with your actual username)
5. If above fails `remcostoeten ALL=NOPASSWD: ALL`
