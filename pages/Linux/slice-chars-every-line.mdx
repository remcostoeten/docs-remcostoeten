# Trimming Lines in a CSV File Using `awk`

In many instances, you might want to trim or extract only a specific number of characters from every line in a file. The `awk` command provides a flexible way to achieve this.

## Command Overview

```shell
awk '{ print substr($0, 1, 14) }' rs.csv > rs_modified.csv
```

## Breakdown

- `'{ print substr($0, 1, 14) }'`:

  - `print`: This tells `awk` to output something.
  - `substr($0, 1, 14)`: This function extracts a substring from the entire line (`$0`). It starts at the first character and captures up to the 14th character.

- `> filename_modified.csv`: This redirects the output of the `awk` command into a file named ` filename_modified.csv`.
