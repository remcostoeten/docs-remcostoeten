# Alphabetically Sorting a File Using `sort`


## Command Overview

\```shell
sort rs.csv > rs_sorted.csv
\```

## Breakdown

- `sort`: This is the Unix command for sorting lines in text files.
  
- `rs.csv`: The input file you wish to sort.

- `> rs_sorted.csv`: Redirects the output of the `sort` command into a new file named `rs_sorted.csv`.

## Overwriting the Original File

Overwrite the original file with the sorted content:

\```shell
sort rs.csv -o rs.csv
\```

Where `-o rs.csv` instructs `sort` to save the sorted output back into the original file.
