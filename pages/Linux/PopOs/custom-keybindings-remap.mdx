## Remap any character without additional libraries. 

## Should also be possible with rebindkey through zsh but couldn;t get it to work so came up with this


### Create a shell script with echo 
```bash filename='rename-pipe-operator.sh'
echo "|"
``

### Then in zsh config
```bash filename='~/.zshrc

# Define a function that executes the shell script
echo_pipe_operator() {
  bash ~/sites/REMCOSTOETEN_DIR/custom-shell-scripts/echo-pipe-operator.sh
}

# Use zle to create a new widget that calls the function
zle -N echo_pipe_operator

# Bind the key sequence to the widget
bindkey '^A' echo_pipe_operator
# Replace 'KEYSEQUENCE' with the actual key sequence for Ctrl + Shift + A in your terml

```

Source zsh or restart terminal and et voila
