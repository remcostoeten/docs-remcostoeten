# Global Prettier with Global Ignore

Setting up Prettier globally can save you the hassle of installing it in every single project. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Install Prettier globally**: Run `npm install -g prettier`.

2. **Create an alias for Prettier**: You might want to create an alias for Prettier with some arguments. For instance, you might not want to format everything. Here's how you can create an alias in zsh or bash:

```bash
# Add this to your ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc file
alias format='prettier --write'
# Or use a shorthand
alias f='format'
```

3. **Exclude certain files**: You might want to exclude certain files or directories, such as `/out`, `/dist`, `/build`, `/node_modules`, `/public`, `/coverage`, `/tmp`, `/temp`, etc. To do this, create a `.prettierignore` file in the root directory where all your config files are located.

```bash
# Create the .prettierignore file
vim ~/.prettierignore
```

Here's an example of what your `.prettierignore` file might look like:

```bash
# .prettierignore

# Ignore Next.js build output
.next/

# Ignore Node modules
node_modules/

# Ignore build directory
build/

# Ignore logs
*.log

# Ignore anything with test in it
*test*

# Ignore anything git related
*git*

public/
```

4. **Apply the .prettierignore file to the alias**: Finally, you need to apply the `.prettierignore` file to the alias you created. Open up your zsh or bash config file again and change the format alias to the following:

```bash
# Add this to your ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc file
alias format='prettier --write --ignore-path ~/.prettierignore'
alias f='format'
```

And that's it! You now have a global Prettier setup with a global ignore file. This will help you keep your code formatted consistently across all your projects, without having to install and configure Prettier in each one. Happy coding!
