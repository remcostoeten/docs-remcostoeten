# copy the entire file coontent to clipboard.

Open zsh via `vim ~/.zshrc` and add the following function:

```bash copy filename='~/.zshrc'
function_copy_file_contents() {
    cat "$1" | xsel --clipboard
}
```

Function name can be anything so `bluecheese() {` would also work but I prefer prefixing with function or fnc so it's easier to search for functions in the file. `$1` is a argument which can be passed, in this case that will be our file to copy.

xsel is clip tool which can be installed via `sudo apt-get install xsel`. It's a clipboard manager which can be used to copy and paste content to clipboard.

Next up create a alias for easy usage of the function:

```bash copy filename='~/.zshrc'
alias copy=function_copy_file_contents
```

which will now do the following. Let's say have note.txt with the following content:

```bash
Hello World
```

You can now do `copy note.txt` and the result on your clipboard will be

```bash
Hello World
```

If feeling mentally sick you could also do `function_copy_file_to_clipboard note.txt` and the result will be the same.

alias copy=function_copy_file_contents
alias copy=copy_file_content
