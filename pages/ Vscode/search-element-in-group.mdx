# Searching for strings in specific folders in VS Code

When working on a large codebase, you may want to search for a string only within a specific folder rather than the entire workspace. Here's how to do targeted searches in VS Code.

## Searching within a subfolder

Let's say you want to find all files containing the string "tippytap" only within this folder:

\`\`\`
src/store/js/components/groups
\`\`\`

But there are also folders like:

\`\`\`
src/store/js/components/selectbox/groups
\`\`\`

that you want to exclude from the search.

You can use a glob pattern in the VS Code search box to target just the folder you want:

\`\`\`
**/src/store/js/components/groups/**/\*.jsx
\`\`\`

This will search for "tippytap" in all .jsx files recursively under src/store/js/components/groups.

To try it out, enter the glob pattern above in the VS Code search box, then enter "tippytap" as the search term. It will only find matches within that one folder.

## Searching in a subfolder while excluding other similar folders

Let's say you want to search in:

\`\`\`
src/store/js/components/subgroups
\`\`\`

But there are also folders like:

\`\`\`
src/store/js/components/groups/subgroups
src/global/js/groups/subgroups
\`\`\`

that contain similar files you want to exclude.

You can use a negative lookahead in the glob pattern to exclude those folders:

\`\`\`
**/src/store/js/components/subgroups/**/\*.jsx
\`\`\`

This will search in src/store/js/components/subgroups while excluding any paths that contain /groups/subgroups after that.

Again, enter this glob pattern in the VS Code search box, then search for "tippytap" to test it out.

## Summary

- Use glob patterns in VS Code search to target specific folders
- Exclude similar folders with negative lookaheads in the glob
- This lets you narrow down search results when dealing with large codebases
